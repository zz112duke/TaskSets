The 3 RL models were created based on: [insert euqation here]


In these files,

1. AlienTask.py reads in files from all subjects and get info about trial stimulus (which alien was presented), optimal TS in the current context,
current context (season), phase (initial learning, cloudy, preference, novel, mixed). The func produce_reward() is probably used to gernerate reward in
model simulation.

2. shared_aliens.py builds up the skeleton of the models ("flat", "hier RL", "Bayes hier RL") and specifies the model parameters (alpha learning rate, beta stochastic rate, f forgetting).
It also contains the functions for simulating different phases.

3. SimulateAliensJupyterVersionFunctions.py actually runs the simulation (call function update_Qs_sim()) for each phase and get summary (call function summary_initial_learn(), etc.).

4. SimulateAliensJupyterVersionBeforeSplittingUp.ipynb partially the same with above but plotting out results.

5. SimulateAliensJupyterVersionPart1SIMULATIONS.ipynb is the first part of the above script, generating all simulations.

6. SimulateAliensJupyterVersionPart2ANALYZEALLSIMULATIONS.ipynb is the second part of 4, analyzing all simulations.

7. SimulateAliensJupyterVersionPart3ANALYZESELECTEDSIMULATIONS.ipynb is the second part of 4, executing selected analyses in the supp material.
