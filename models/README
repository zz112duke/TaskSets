The 3 RL models were created based on: [insert euqation here]


In these files,

1. AlienTask.py reads in files from all subjects and get info about trial stimulus (which alien was presented), optimal TS in the current context,
current context (season), phase (initial learning, cloudy, preference, novel, mixed). The func produce_reward() is probably used to gernerate reward in
model simulation.

2. shared_aliens.py builds up the skeleton of the models ("flat", "hier RL", "Bayes hier RL") and specifies the model parameters (alpha learning rate, beta stochastic rate, f forgetting).
It also contains the functions (the skeletons) for simulating different phases.

3. SimulateAliensJupyterVersionFunctions.py actually 
  A. RUNs the simulation: i)call function update_Qs_sim() for initial learning and cloudy phase (simulating initial learning and cloudy phase
  doesn't require a compressed function from shared_aliens.py, unlike rainbow and comp that has a function for everything) and ii)simulate_rainbow_phase()
  and simulate_competition_phase() for rainbow and competition phase simulation. 
  B. And get model summary: i)call get_summary_initial_learn() and get_summary_cloudy(). ii)get summaries for rainbow season and competition are done within the get_summary() function 
  because getting summaries for these two phases doesn't require any function, it's relatively straight-forward.
  
  # So for initial and cloudy, simulation by steps without shared_aliens.py functions, but require shared_aliens.py function for model summary;
  # Whereas for rainbow and comp, simulation reuqires shared_aliens.py functions but getting summary is easy.
  # Note that even though the func get_summary() is called get_summary, the simulation actually happens inside there.

4. SimulateAliensJupyterVersionBeforeSplittingUp.ipynb partially the same with above but plotting out results.

5. SimulateAliensJupyterVersionPart1SIMULATIONS.ipynb is the first part of the above script, generating all simulations.

6. SimulateAliensJupyterVersionPart2ANALYZEALLSIMULATIONS.ipynb is the second part of 4, analyzing all simulations.

7. SimulateAliensJupyterVersionPart3ANALYZESELECTEDSIMULATIONS.ipynb is the second part of 4, executing selected analyses in the supp material.
